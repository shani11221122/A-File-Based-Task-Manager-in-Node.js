FileTasker is a lightweight task management web app built with Node.js, Express.js, and EJS that stores tasks as individual .txt files in the filesystem.

This app allows you to:

✅ Create new tasks with custom details

📂 View existing tasks stored in the /files directory

✏️ Rename tasks via the Edit option

📃 View task content directly

It uses file-based storage instead of a database, making it beginner-friendly and ideal for learning file handling, routing, and templating with EJS in Node.js.
